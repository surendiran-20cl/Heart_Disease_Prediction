# Heart_Disease_Prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict heart disease based on medical data such as age, cholesterol, and blood pressure. Models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest are evaluated using accuracy and ROC-AUC. Random Forest achieved the best performance, making it the most reliable predictor for early diagnosis.
